## Research
Hooks - Good alternative to classes, cleaner code, no need for "this" to bind functions and can be reused

## Important hooks:
* useEffect() - takes in a function and array of values. Used to apply actions outside of React
* useState() - used to initialize state (Ex. const [value, setValue] = useState(0)). Takes in a value and returns function that updates the state of the value.
* useRef() - creates a mutable reference object that retains its value throughout its lifecycle.

## general
Created initial implementation for incremental sort using hooks and state with react. 

## issues
* had some issues getting the values to update when the got changed
* How to structure the code with the hooks and functions needed became quite a challenge

## fixes
* After implementing the initial draft we disscussed how we could improve upon the design and came up with some good improvements. Such that we can step both forward and backward. right now the prototype is only stepping through

## Implemented
* implemented colors for the incremental sort prototype
* started implementing dfs with new structure in mind from earlier discussion.

# issues
* getting the colors to be changed and placed in the right places took some time. They didn't change as expected and so became quite problematic.
* Have been hard finding a good way to visualize the dfs search algorithm since displaying nodes

## Implemnetations
* With the help of PKD libraries, implemented graphs.
