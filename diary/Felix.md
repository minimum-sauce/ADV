Hooks - Good alternative to classes, cleaner code, no need for "this" to bind functions and can be reused

# important hooks: 
* useEffect() - takes in a function and array of values. Used to apply actions outside of React
* useState() - used to initialize state (Ex. const [value, setValue] = useState(0)). 
  Takes in a value and returns function that updates the state of the value.
* useRef() - creates a mutable reference object that retains its value throughout its lifecycle.
